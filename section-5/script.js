 *  - Everything is an object... (Almost Everything). This is one of the unique and fundamental
 *  things about JS compared to other languages.
 *  - Object Oriented Programming : Objects interacting with one anotehr through methods and properties.
 *  Additionally, used to store data, structures, etc.
 *  - Constructor : Acts as a blueprint and creates instances of objects
 *  - Inheritance : When one object is based on another object.
